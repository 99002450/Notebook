# Todo List
1. Threads and IPC pre read(unit tom-9:30)
2. Study of Core C++ (22nd)
3. Study of Advanced C++(23rd)
    - Part1
    - Part2
    - Coding Tasks
    - Project Implementation
4. SDLC (22)

## Oct 21
Activities:-
* post read of covered topics + practice examples
* continue coding tasks
* refresh thread & ipc concepts (linux os, posix apis)
	* threads
	* mutex
	* semaphore
	* producer consumer problem
	* deadlocks
Further:-
* concurrency in C++ ==> std::thread, std::async
* IPC techniques  ==> std::mutex, some locks, std::condition_variable etc.
* std::future, std::promise (if time permits


## Oct 20
1. refresh move semantics, lambdas (covered topics)
    * check for the trvial and non trivial classes
    * Check copy constrcutor for trivial and non trivial casses
    * Algorithms and Lamda(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm)
    * Apply all this concepts  
2. explore STL algorithms, apply in coding tasks with lambdas
3. self study (try) -- file handling -- ofstream, ifstream
4. pre-read
    std::bind
    some topics on templates
    smart pointers
5. vs setup for code style,visulaization and analysis
