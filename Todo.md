## Todo(Oct 20)
1. refresh move semantics, lambdas (covered topics)
    * check for the trvial and non trivial classes
    * Check copy constrcutor for trivial and non trivial casses
    * Algorithms and Lamda(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm)
    * Apply all this concepts  
2. explore STL algorithms, apply in coding tasks with lambdas
3. self study (try) -- file handling -- ofstream, ifstream
4. pre-read
    std::bind
    some topics on templates
    smart pointers
5. vs setup for code style,visulaization and analysis
