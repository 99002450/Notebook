# Virtual functions :

* A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. 

* Pointer Created of base type will point to derived members if it is virtual in base clan

* If we have created a virtual function in the base class and it is being overridden in the derived class then we donâ€™t need virtual keyword in the derived class, functions are automatically considered as virtual functions in the derived class.

* They are always defined in base class and overridden in derived class. It is not mandatory for derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case base class version of function is used.

* C++ provides facility to specify that the compiler should match function calls with the correct definition at the run time; this is called dynamic binding or late binding or run-time binding. Dynamic binding is achieved using virtual functions. Base class pointer points to derived class object.

*  pure virtual functions eg : virtual void credit(double)=0;  


## Pure Virtual Functions
* int credit(double)=0;  - expecting return to 0

## Example

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
class base { 
public: 
    void fun_1() { cout << "base-1\n"; } 
    virtual void fun_2() { cout << "base-2\n"; } 
    virtual void fun_3() { cout << "base-3\n"; } 
    virtual void fun_4() { cout << "base-4\n"; } 
}; 
  
class derived : public base { 
public: 
    void fun_1() { cout << "derived-1\n"; } 
    void fun_2() { cout << "derived-2\n"; } 
    void fun_4(int x) { cout << "derived-4\n"; } 
}; 
  
int main() 
{ 
    base* p; 
    derived obj1; 
    p = &obj1; 
  
    // Early binding because fun1() is non-virtual 
    // in base 
    p->fun_1(); 
  
    // Late binding (RTP) 
    p->fun_2(); 
  
    // Late binding (RTP) 
    p->fun_3(); 
  
    // Late binding (RTP) 
    p->fun_4(); 
  
    // Early binding but this function call is 
    // illegal(produces error) becasue pointer 
    // is of base type and function is of 
    // derived class 
    // p->fun_4(5); 
} 

Output:

base-1
derived-2
base-3
base-4
